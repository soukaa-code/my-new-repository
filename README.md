#Hello world
#This is one of my HTML beginner project 
#It's a survey form page that I have created to get some data from the users related to their culture , environment .. without requiring their personal data 
#Sorry , if you didn't like the design I am still a beginner and haven't learned yet how to design using CSS.
#Thank's to freecodecamp.org for helping me through my coding journey  .
